# AVL Tree Background

An AVL Tree (Adelson-Velsky and Landis Tree) is a self-balancing binary search tree introduced by Soviet mathematicians Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis in 1962. It is a type of data structure that automatically maintains its balance as nodes are inserted and deleted, ensuring efficient operations.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Balance Property:** The AVL Tree maintains a balance condition where, for any node in the tree, the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by no more than one. This property ensures that the tree remains approximately balanced, leading to O(log n) time complexity for basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and lookup.

2. **Rotations:** To maintain this balance after insertions or deletions, AVL Trees use rotations. There are four types of rotations:
   - Right Rotation (Single Rotation)
   - Left Rotation (Single Rotation)
   - Left-Right Rotation (Double Rotation)
   - Right-Left Rotation (Double Rotation)

3. **Height Balance Factor:** Each node in an AVL Tree has a balance factor, which is the difference between the heights of its left and right subtrees. The balance factor can be -1, 0, or 1 for a balanced tree. If a node's balance factor is outside this range, rotations are performed to restore balance.

4. **Performance:** Because AVL Trees maintain their balance, they provide reliable performance for search operations, insertion, and deletion, all of which have a time complexity of O(log n) in the worst case.

5. **Applications:** AVL Trees are used in various applications where frequent insertions and deletions require efficient search times, such as in databases, memory management, and real-time systems.

By maintaining a balanced structure, AVL Trees offer a guarantee of logarithmic height, ensuring that operations are performed efficiently even with large datasets.
